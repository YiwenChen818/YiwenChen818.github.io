                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pumpkin (about 300g)</li>
                    <li>Garlic (2 cloves)</li>
                    <li>Flour (2 tablespoons)</li>
                    <li>Egg (1)</li>
                    <li>Onion (1)</li>
                    <li>Potatoes (2)</li>
                    <li>Milk or cream (1 cup)</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
                    <li>Herring (2-3)</li>
                    <li>Butter (2 tablespoons)</li>
                    <li>Pie crust (1-2 sheets)</li>
                    <li>Thyme (1 teaspoon)</li>

                <h2>Step-by-step Instructions:</h2>
                <p>a. Processing the pumpkin and potatoes: Boil the pumpkin cubes and potato slices in salted water until slightly softened, drain and set aside.</p>
                <p>b. Sauté the filling: Heat the butter in a pan, add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until the onion is soft. Add the pumpkin and potatoes and continue to sauté for 2-3 minutes until the ingredients are evenly heated. Add the cubed herring to the pan and sauté gently for a few minutes until it has browned. Season with salt, pepper, and thyme.</p>
                <p>c. Make the sauce: Melt the butter in a separate pan, add the flour and stir until well mixed. Slowly add the milk or cream, whisking constantly, until the sauce has thickened. Pour the sauce over the sautéed filling and stir well to coat all the ingredients.</p>
                <p>d. Assemble the pie: Lay a pie crust in the bottom of a pie dish and pour in the prepared filling. If you have a leftover pie crust, cut it into strips and weave them into a lattice to cover the filling, or just cover the entire pie crust and cut a few small slits in the top to allow for venting. Brush the pie crust with beaten egg wash to give it a golden color when baking.</p>
                <p>e. Bake: Place the pie in a preheated 350°F (180°C) oven and bake for 30-40 minutes until the crust is golden and crisp.</p>
                <p>f. Enjoy: Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before slicing and serving. The combination of herring and pumpkin is richly flavored with a tangy sauce and crispy pie crust.</p>

                    <p>a. Sauté vegetables: Heat olive oil or butter in a large pan. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until the onion is soft and transparent. Add the chopped carrot and squash pieces and continue to sauté for about 5 minutes to soften the vegetables slightly.</p>
